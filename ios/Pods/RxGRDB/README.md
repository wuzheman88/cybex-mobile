## Usage

RxGRDB produces observable sequences from database requests. For example:

```swift
Player.order(score.desc).limit(10)
    .rx
    .fetchAll(in: dbQueue)
    .subscribe(onNext: { players: [Player] in
        print("Best ten players have changed")
    })

Player.filter(key: 1)
    .rx
    .fetchOne(in: dbQueue)
    .subscribe(onNext: { player: Player? in
        print("Player 1 has changed")
    })
```

To connect to the database and define the tracked requests, please refer to [GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift), the database library that supports RxGRDB.

## What is Database Observation?

**RxGRDB notifies changes that have been committed in the database.** No insertion, update, or deletion in tracked tables is missed. This includes indirect changes triggered by [foreign keys](https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_actions) or [SQL triggers](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtrigger.html).

> :point_up: **Note**: some special changes are not notified: changes to SQLite system tables (such as `sqlite_master`), and changes to [`WITHOUT ROWID`](https://www.sqlite.org/withoutrowid.html) tables. See [Data Change Notification Callbacks](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/update_hook.html) for more information.

To function correctly, RxGRDB requires that a unique [database connection] is kept open during the whole duration of the observation.

**To define which part of the database should be observed, you provide a database request.** Requests can be expressed with GRDB's [query interface], as in `Player.all()`, or with SQL, as in `SELECT * FROM players`. Both would observe the full "players" database table. Observed requests can involve several database tables, and generally be as complex as you need them to be.

**Change notifications may happen even though the request results are the same.** RxGRDB often notifies of *potential changes*, not of *actual changes*. A transaction triggers a change notification if and only if a statement has actually modified the tracked tables and columns by inserting, updating, or deleting a row.

For example, if you track `Player.select(max(scoreColumn))`, then you'll get a notification for all changes performed on the `score` column of the `players` table (updates, insertions and deletions), even if they do not modify the value of the maximum score. However, you will not get any notification for changes performed on other database tables, or updates to other columns of the `players` table.

It is possible to avoid notifications of identical consecutive values. For example you can use the [`distinctUntilChanged`](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/distinct.html) operator of RxSwift. You can also let RxGRDB perform efficient deduplication at the database level: see the documentation of each reactive method for more information.

**RxGRDB observables are based on GRDB's [TransactionObserver] protocol.** If your application needs change notifications that are not built in RxGRDB, this versatile protocol will probably provide a solution.


# Observing Individual Requests

**When your application observes a request, it gets notified each time a change in the results of the request has been committed in the database.**

If you are only interested in the *values* fetched by the request, then RxGRDB can fetch them for you after each database modification, and emit them in order, ready for consumption. See the [rx.fetchCount](#requestrxfetchcountinstartimmediatelyscheduler), [rx.fetchOne](#typedrequestrxfetchoneinstartimmediatelyscheduler), and [rx.fetchAll](#typedrequestrxfetchallinstartimmediatelyscheduler) methods, depending on whether you want to track the number of results, the first one, or all of them:

```swift
let request = Player.all()
request.rx.fetchCount(in: dbQueue) // Observable<Int>
request.rx.fetchOne(in: dbQueue)   // Observable<Player?>
request.rx.fetchAll(in: dbQueue)   // Observable<[Player]>
```

Some applications need to be synchronously notified right after any impactful transaction has been committed, and before any further database modification. This feature is provided by the [rx.changes](#requestrxchangesinstartimmediately) method:

```swift
let request = Player.all()
request.rx.changes(in: dbQueue)    // Observable<Database>
```

- [`rx.changes`](#requestrxchangesinstartimmediately)
- [`rx.fetchCount`](#requestrxfetchcountinstartimmediatelyscheduler)
- [`rx.fetchOne`](#typedrequestrxfetchoneinstartimmediatelyschedulerdistinctuntilchanged)
- [`rx.fetchAll`](#typedrequestrxfetchallinstartimmediatelyschedulerdistinctuntilchanged)


---

#### `Request.rx.changes(in:startImmediately:)`

This [database changes observable](#changes-observables) emits a database connection after each [impactful](#what-is-database-observation) database transaction:

```swift
let request = Player.all()
request.rx.changes(in: dbQueue) // or dbPool
    .subscribe(onNext: { db: Database in
        print("Players table has changed.")
    })

try dbQueue.inDatabase { db in
    try Player.deleteAll(db)
    // Prints "Players table has changed."
}

try dbQueue.inTransaction { db in
    try Player(name: "Arthur").insert(db)
    try Player(name: "Barbara").insert(db)
    return .commit
    // Prints "Players table has changed."
}
```

All elements are emitted in a protected database dispatch queue, serialized with all database updates. If you set `startImmediately` to true (the default value), the first element is emitted synchronously, right upon subscription. See [GRDB Concurrency Guide] for more information.

**You can also track SQL requests:**

```swift
let request = SQLRequest("SELECT * FROM players")
request.rx.changes(in: dbQueue)
    .subscribe(onNext: { db: Database in
        print("Players table has changed.")
    })

try dbQueue.inDatabase { db in
    try db.execute("DELETE FROM players")
    // Prints "Players table has changed."
}
```

> :point_up: **Note**: see [GRDB requests] for more information about requests in general, and SQLRequest in particular.


---

#### `Request.rx.fetchCount(in:startImmediately:scheduler:)`

This [database values observable](#values-observables) emits a count after each [impactful](#what-is-database-observation) database transaction:

```swift
let request = Player.all()
request.rx.fetchCount(in: dbQueue) // or dbPool
    .subscribe(onNext: { count: Int in
        print("Number of players: \(count)")
    })

try dbQueue.inTransaction { db in
    try Player.deleteAll(db)
    try Player(name: "Arthur").insert(db)
    return .commit
    // Eventually prints "Number of players: 1"
}
```

All elements are emitted on `scheduler`, which defaults to `MainScheduler.instance`. If you set `startImmediately` to true (the default value), the first element is emitted right upon subscription.

**This observable may emit identical consecutive values**, because RxGRDB tracks [potential](#what-is-database-observation) changes. Use the [`distinctUntilChanged`](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/distinct.html) operator in order to avoid duplicates:

```swift
request.rx.fetchCount(in: dbQueue).distinctUntilChanged()...
```


---

#### `TypedRequest.rx.fetchOne(in:startImmediately:scheduler:distinctUntilChanged:)`

This [database values observable](#values-observables) emits a value after each [impactful](#what-is-database-observation) database transaction:

```swift
let playerId = 42
let request = Player.filter(key: playerId)
request.rx.fetchOne(in: dbQueue) // or dbPool
    .subscribe(onNext: { player: Player? in
        print("Player has changed")
    })

try dbQueue.inDatabase { db in
    guard let player = Player.fetchOne(key: playerId) else { return }
    
    player.score += 100
    try player.update(db)
    // Eventually prints "Player has changed"
    
    try player.delete(db)
    // Eventually prints "Player has changed"
}
```

All elements are emitted on `scheduler`, which defaults to `MainScheduler.instance`. If you set `startImmediately` to true (the default value), the first element is emitted right upon subscription.

**You can also track SQL requests, and choose the fetched type** (database [row](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/master/README.md#row-queries), plain [value](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/master/README.md#values), custom [record](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/master/README.md#records)). The sample code below tracks an `Int` value fetched from a custom SQL request:

```swift
let request = SQLRequest("SELECT MAX(score) FROM rounds").asRequest(of: Int.self)
request.rx.fetchOne(in: dbQueue)
    .subscribe(onNext: { maxScore: Int? in
        print(maxScore)
    })
```

When tracking a *value*, you get nil in two cases: either the request yielded no database row, or one row with a NULL value.

> :point_up: **Note**: see [GRDB requests] for more information about requests in general, and SQLRequest in particular.

**This observable may emit identical consecutive values**, because RxGRDB tracks [potential](#what-is-database-observation) changes. Use the `distinctUntilChanged` parameter in order to avoid duplicates:

```swift
request.rx.fetchOne(in: dbQueue, distinctUntilChanged: true)...
```

The `distinctUntilChanged` parameter does not involve the fetched type, and simply performs comparisons of raw database values.


---

#### `TypedRequest.rx.fetchAll(in:startImmediately:scheduler:distinctUntilChanged:)`

This [database values observable](#values-observables) emits an array of values after each [impactful](#what-is-database-observation) database transaction:

```swift
let request = Player.order(Column("name"))
request.rx.fetchAll(in: dbQueue) // or dbPool
    .subscribe(onNext: { players: [Player] in
        print(players.map { $0.name })
    })

try dbQueue.inTransaction { db in
    try Player.deleteAll(db)
    try Player(name: "Arthur").insert(db)
    try Player(name: "Barbara").insert(db)
    return .commit
    // Eventually prints "[Arthur, Barbara]"
}
```

All elements are emitted on `scheduler`, which defaults to `MainScheduler.instance`. If you set `startImmediately` to true (the default value), the first element is emitted right upon subscription.

**You can also track SQL requests, and choose the fetched type** (database [row](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/master/README.md#row-queries), plain [value](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/master/README.md#values), custom [record](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/master/README.md#records)). The sample code below tracks an array of `URL` values fetched from a custom SQL request:

```swift
let request = SQLRequest("SELECT url FROM links").asRequest(of: URL.self)
request.rx.fetchAll(in: dbQueue)
    .subscribe(onNext: { urls: [URL] in
        print(urls)
    })
```

When tracking *values*, make sure to ask for optionals when database may contain NULL:

```swift
let request = SQLRequest("SELECT email FROM players").asRequest(of: Optional<String>.self)
request.rx.fetchAll(in: dbQueue)
    .subscribe(onNext: { emails: [String?] in
        print(emails)
    })
```

> :point_up: **Note**: see [GRDB requests] for more information about requests in general, and SQLRequest in particular.

**This observable may emit identical consecutive values**, because RxGRDB tracks [potential](#what-is-database-observation) changes. Use the `distinctUntilChanged` parameter in order to avoid duplicates:

```swift
request.rx.fetchAll(in: dbQueue, distinctUntilChanged: true)...
```

The `distinctUntilChanged` parameter does not involve the fetched type, and simply performs comparisons of raw database values.


# Observing Multiple Requests

We have seen above how to [observe individual requests](#observing-individual-requests):

```swift
let request = Player.all()
request.rx.changes(in: dbQueue)    // Observable<Database>
request.rx.fetchCount(in: dbQueue) // Observable<Int>
request.rx.fetchOne(in: dbQueue)   // Observable<Player?>
request.rx.fetchAll(in: dbQueue)   // Observable<[Player]>
```

Those observables can be composed together using [RxSwift operators](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift). However, be careful: those operators are unable to fulfill some database-specific requirements:

To get a single notification when a transaction has modified several requests, use [DatabaseWriter.rx.changes](#databasewriterrxchangesinstartimmediately).

When you need to fetch from several requests with the guarantee of consistent results, that is to say when you need values that come alltogether from a single database transaction, see [Fetch Tokens](#fetch-tokens).

See the [Data Consistency](#data-consistency) chapter for more information.

- [`DatabaseWriter.rx.changes`](#databasewriterrxchangesinstartimmediately)
- [Fetch tokens](#fetch-tokens)
- [`DatabaseWriter.rx.fetchTokens`](#databasewriterrxfetchtokensinstartimmediatelyscheduler)
- [`Observable.mapFetch`](#observablemapfetch_)


---

#### `DatabaseWriter.rx.changes(in:startImmediately:)`

This [database changes observable](#changes-observables) emits a database connection after each database transaction that has an [impact](#what-is-database-observation) on any of the tracked requests:

```swift
let players = Player.all()
let teams = Team.all()
dbQueue.rx.changes(in: [players, teams]) // or dbPool
    .subscribe(onNext: { db: Database in
        print("Changes in players or teams table")
    })

try dbQueue.inDatabase { db in
    try Player.deleteAll(db)
    // Prints "Changes in players or teams table"
}

try dbQueue.inTransaction { db in
    let team = Team(name: "Blue")
    try team.insert(db)
    try Player(name: "Arthur", teamId: team.id).insert(db)
    return .commit
    // Prints "Changes in players or teams table"
}
```

All elements are emitted in a protected database dispatch queue, serialized with all database updates. If you set `startImmediately` to true (the default value), the first element is emitted synchronously, right upon subscription. See [GRDB Concurrency Guide] for more information.

**You can also track SQL requests:**

```swift
let players = SQLRequest("SELECT * FROM players")
let teams = SQLRequest("SELECT * FROM teams")
dbQueue.rx.changes(in: [players, teams])
    .subscribe(onNext: { db: Database in
        print("Changes in players or teams table")
    })

try dbQueue.inDatabase { db in
    try db.execute("DELETE FROM players")
    // Prints "Changes in players or teams table"
}
```

> :point_up: **Note**: see [GRDB requests] for more information about requests in general, and SQLRequest in particular.


---

## Fetch tokens

**Generally speaking, *fetch tokens* let you turn notifications of database changes into fetched values. But the requests you observe don't have to be the same as the requests you fetch from.**

To introduce them, let's start with a simple request observable:

```swift
let request = Player.all()
request.rx.fetchAll(in: dbQueue) // Observable<[Player]>
```

After each modification of the players database table, the observable above emits a fresh array of players (see [rx.fetchAll](#typedrequestrxfetchallinstartimmediatelyschedulerdistinctuntilchanged) for more options).

The job performed by this observable is decomposed into two steps: observe database modifications, and fetch fresh results after each modification. These two steps are made visible below:

```swift
// The very same Observable<[Player]>
dbQueue.rx
    .fetchTokens(in: [request])        // 1. observe modifications
    .mapFetch { (db: Database) in       // 2. fetch fresh results
        return try request.fetchAll(db)
    }
```

`fetchTokens` emits *fetch tokens* for all database transactions that modifies some requests. Those fetch tokens are opaque values that are turned into the fetched results of your choice by the `mapFetch` operator.

When a single request is involved, it is used as both the source of tracked changes, and the source of the fetched results. But you can observe some requests and fetch from other ones:

```swift
// When the players table is changed, fetch the ten best ones, as well as the
// total number of players:
dbQueue.rx
    .fetchTokens(in: [Player.all()])
    .mapFetch { (db: Database) -> ([Player], Int) in
        let players = try Player.order(scoreColumn.desc).limit(10).fetchAll(db)
        let count = try Player.fetchCount(db)
        return (players, count)
    }
    .subscribe(onNext: { (players, count) in
        print("Best ten players out of \(count): \(players)")
    })
```

- [`DatabaseWriter.rx.fetchTokens`](#databasewriterrxfetchtokensinstartimmediatelyscheduler)
- [`Observable.mapFetch`](#observablemapfetch_)


---

#### `DatabaseWriter.rx.fetchTokens(in:startImmediately:scheduler:)`

This observable emits a [fetch token](#fetch-tokens) after each database transaction that has an [impact](#what-is-database-observation) on any of the tracked requests:

```swift
let players = Player.all()
let teams = Team.all()

// Observable<FetchToken>
let fetchTokens = dbQueue.rx.fetchTokens(in: [players, teams]) // or dbPool
```

Fetch tokens are opaque values: you can't use them directly. Instead, sequences of fetch tokens are designed to be consumed by the [mapFetch](#observablemapfetch_) operator.

The `scheduler` and `startImmediately` parameters are used to control the delivery of fetched elements by the mapFetch operator. See below.

> :point_up: **Note**: RxGRDB does not support any alteration of fetch tokens sequences by the way of any RxSwift operator. Don't skip elements, don't merge sequences, etc.


---

#### `Observable.mapFetch(_:)`

The `mapFetch` operator transforms a sequence of [fetch tokens](#fetch-tokens) into a [database values observable](#values-observables).

```swift
let fetchTokens = dbQueue.rx.fetchTokens(in: ...)
    
// Observable<[Player]>
let players = fetchTokens.mapFetch { (db: Database) in
    try Player.fetchAll(db)
}
```

The `scheduler` and `startImmediately` parameters are used to build the sequence of fetch tokens control the delivery of fetched elements:

All elements are emitted on `scheduler`, which defaults to `MainScheduler.instance`. If you set `startImmediately` to true (the default value), the first element is emitted right upon subscription.

**The closure provided to `mapFetch` is guaranteed an immutable view of the last committed state of the database.** This means that you can perform several fetches without fearing eventual concurrent writes to mess with your application logic:

```swift
// When the players table is changed, fetch the ten best ones, as well
// as the total number of players:
dbQueue.rx
    .fetchTokens(in: [Player.all()])
    .mapFetch { (db: Database) -> ([Player], Int) in
        let players = try Player.order(scoreColumn.desc).limit(10).fetchAll(db)
        let count = try Player.fetchCount(db)
        return (players, count)
    }
    .subscribe(onNext: { (players, count) in
        print("Best ten players out of \(count): \(players)")
    })
```


# Diffs

Since RxGRDB is able to track database changes, it is a natural desire to compute diffs between two consecutive request results.

**There are several diff algorithms**: you'll have to pick the one that suits your needs.

RxGRDB ships with one diff algorithm which computes the inserted, updated, and deleted elements between two record arrays. This algorithm is well suited for collections whose order does not matter, such as annotations in a map view. See [`PrimaryKeyDiffScanner`](#primarykeydiffscanner).

For other diff algorithms, we advise you to have a look to [Differ](https://github.com/tonyarnold/Differ), [Dwifft](https://github.com/jflinter/Dwifft), or your favorite diffing library. RxGRDB ships with a [demo application](Documentation/RxGRDBDemo) that uses Differ in order to animate the content of a table view.


## PrimaryKeyDiffScanner

PrimaryKeyDiffScanner computes diffs between collections whose order does not matter. It is well suited, for example, for synchronizing annotations in a map view with the contents of the database.

Its algorithm has a low complexity of `O(max(N,M))`, where `N` and `M` are the sizes of two consecutive request results.

```swift
struct PrimaryKeyDiffScanner<Record: RowConvertible & MutablePersistable> {
    let diff: PrimaryKeyDiff<Record>
    func diffed(from rows: [Row]) -> PrimaryKeyDiffScanner
}

struct PrimaryKeyDiff<Record> {
    let inserted: [Record]
    let updated: [Record]
    let deleted: [Record]
}
```

Everything starts from a GRDB [record type](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/master/README.md#records), and a request, ordered by primary key, whose results are used to compute diffs after each [impactful](#what-is-database-observation) database transaction:

```swift
let request = Place.order(Column("id"))
```

> :point_up: **Note**: if the primary key contains string column(s), then they must be sorted according to the default [BINARY collation](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#collation) of SQLite (which lexicographically sorts the UTF8 representation of strings).

You then create the PrimaryKeyDiffScanner, with a database connection and an eventual initial array of records which is used to compute the first diff:

```swift
let scanner = try dbQueue.inDatabase { db in
    try PrimaryKeyDiffScanner(
        database: db,
        request: request,
        initialRecords: []) // initial records must be sorted by primary key
}
```

Now is the time to compute diffs. Diffs are computed from raw database rows, so we need to turn the record request into a row request before feeding the scanner:

```swift
let rowRequest = request.asRequest(of: Row.self)

// The scanner is designed to feed the built-in RxSwift `scan` operator:
rowRequest.rx
    .fetchAll(in: dbQueue)
    .scan(scanner) { (scanner, rows) in scanner.diffed(from: rows) }
    .subscribe(onNext: { scanner in
        let diff = scanner.diff
        print("inserted \(diff.inserted.count) records")
        print("updated \(diff.updated.count) records")
        print("deleted \(diff.deleted.count) records")
    })
```

Check the [demo application](Documentation/RxGRDBDemo) for an example app that uses `PrimaryKeyDiffScanner` to synchronize the content of a map view with the content of the database.


# Scheduling

GRDB and RxGRDB go a long way in order to smooth out subtleties of multi-threaded SQLite. You're unlikely to use those libraries in a *very* wrong way.

Some applications are demanding: this chapter attempts at making RxGRDB scheduling as clear as possible. Please have a look at [GRDB Concurrency Guide](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/master/README.md#concurrency) first.

- [Scheduling Guarantees](#scheduling-guarantees)
- [Data Consistency](#data-consistency)
- [Changes Observables vs. Values Observables](#changes-observables-vs-values-observables)
- [Changes Observables](#changes-observables)
- [Values Observables](#values-observables)
- [Common Use Cases of Values Observables](#common-use-cases-of-values-observables)


## Scheduling Guarantees

RxGRDB inherits from [GRDB guarantees](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/master/README.md#guarantees-and-rules), and adds two more:

- :bowtie: **RxGRDB Guarantee 1: all observables can be created and subscribed from any thread.**
    
    Not all can be observed on any thread, though: see [Changes Observables vs. Values Observables](#changes-observables-vs-values-observables)

- :bowtie: **RxGRDB Guarantee 2: all observables emit their values in the same chronological order as transactions.**


## Data Consistency

[Data Consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_(database_systems)) is the highly desirable quality that prevents your app from displaying funny values on screen, or worse.

SQLite itself guarantees consistency at the database level by the mean of the database schema, relational constraints, integrity checks, foreign key actions, triggers, and transactions.

At the application level, data consistency is guaranteed as long as the fetched values all come from the result of a single transaction.

When you use RxGRDB to observe values that come from a [single request](#observing-individual-requests), data consistency is always guaranteed, even when the request uses several database tables:

```swift
Player.all()
    .rx.fetchAll(in: dbQueue)
    .subscribe(onNext: { players in
        print("Consistent players: \(players)")
    })

SQLRequest("""
    SELECT teams.*, COUNT(DISTINCT players.id) AS playerCount
    FROM teams
    LEFT JOIN players ON players.teamId = teams.id
    GROUP BY teams.id
    """)
    .asRequest(of: TeamInfo.self)
    .rx.fetchAll(in: dbQueue)
    .subscribe(onNext: { teamInfos in
        print("Consistent team infos: \(teamInfos)")
    })
```

When you use RxGRDB to observe values that come from several requests, data consistency needs your help.

Here is a "wrong" way to do it:

```swift
// NON-GUARANTEED DATA CONSISTENCY
Player.all()
    .rx.fetchAll(in: dbQueue)
    .map { players in
        let teams = try dbQueue.inDatabase { try Team.fetchAll($0) }
        return (players, teams)
    }
    .subscribe(onNext: { (players, teams) in
        updateView(players: players, teams: teams)
    })
```

The above observable doesn't fetch players and teams at the same time. It may output players without any team, or teams without any players, or teams with unreferenced players, etc., despite the constraints of your database schema.

This may be acceptable. Or not.

When this is not acceptable, make sure to read the [Observing Multiple Requests](#observing-multiple-requests) chapter. You are likely to use [fetch tokens](#fetch-tokens):

```swift
// GUARANTEED DATA CONSISTENCY
let playersRequest = Player.all()
dbQueue.rx
    .fetchTokens(in: [playersRequest])
    .mapFetch { db in
        try (playersRequest.fetchAll(db), Team.fetchAll(db))
    }
    .subscribe(onNext: { (players, teams) in
        updateView(players: players, teams: teams)
    })
```

When you use a [database pool](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/master/README.md#database-pools), you may also find [snapshots](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/master/README.md#database-snapshots) interesting (GRDB 2.9+):

```swift
// GUARANTEED DATA CONSISTENCY
let playersRequest = Player.all()
dbPool.rx
    .changes(in: [playersRequest])
    .map { _ in try dbPool.makeSnapshot() }
    .subscribe(onNext: { snapshot in
        updateView(from: snapshot)
    })
```


## Changes Observables vs. Values Observables

**RxGRDB provides two sets of observables: changes observables, and values observables.** Changes observables emit database connections, and values observables emit values (records, rows, ints, etc.):

```swift
// A changes observable:
Player.filter(key: 1).rx
    .changes(in: dbQueue)
    .subscribe(onNext: { db: Database in
        print("Player 1 has changed.")
    })

// A values observable:
Player.all().rx
    .fetchAll(in: dbQueue)
    .subscribe(onNext: { players: [Player] in
        print("Players have changed.")
    })
```

[Fetch tokens](#fetch-tokens) build values observables as well:

```swift
// A values observable:
dbQueue
    .fetchTokens(in: [Player.all()])
    .mapFetch { (db: Database) -> ([Player], Int) in
        let players = try Player.order(scoreColumn.desc).limit(10).fetchAll(db)
        let count = try Player.fetchCount(db)
        return (players, count)
    }
    .subscribe(onNext: { (players, count) in
        print("Best ten players out of \(count): \(players)")
    })
```

As a rule of thumb, you always read `changes` in the definition of changes observables, and you always read `fetch` in the definition of values observables.

Since changes and values observables don't have the same behavior, we'd like you to understand the differences.


## Changes Observables

**Changes Observable are all about being synchronously notified of any [impactful](#what-is-database-observation) transaction.** They can be created and subscribed from any thread. They all emit database connections in a "protected dispatch queue", serialized with all database updates:

```swift
// On any thread
Player.all().rx
    .changes(in: dbQueue)
    .subscribe(onNext: { db: Database in
        // On the database protected dispatch queue
        print("Players have changed.")
    })

// On any thread
dbQueue.rx
    .changes(in: [Player.all(), Team.all()])
    .subscribe(onNext: { db: Database in
        // On the database protected dispatch queue
        print("Changes in players or teams table")
    })
```

**Changes observables must be observed on a database protected dispatch queue.** If you change the observation queue, you get a "Database was not used on the correct thread" fatal error:

```swift
Player.all().rx
    .changes(in: dbQueue)
    .observeOn(SerialDispatchQueueScheduler(qos: .userInitiated))
    .subscribe(onNext: { db: Database in
        // fatal error
        let players = try Player.fetchAll(db)
        ...
    })
```

**A changes observable blocks all threads that are writing in the database, or attempting to write in the database:**

```swift
// Wait 1 second on every change to the players table
Player.all().rx
    .changes(in: dbQueue)
    .subscribe(onNext: { db: Database in
        sleep(1)
    })

print(Date())
try dbQueue.inTransaction { db in
    try Player(name: "Arthur").insert(db)
    return .commit // Triggers the observable, and waits 1 second
}
print(Date()) // 1+ second later
```

When one uses a [database queue], all reads are blocked as well. A [database pool] allows concurrent reads.

**Because all writes are blocked, a changes observable guarantees access to the latest state of the database, exactly as it is written on disk.**

*This is a very strong guarantee, that most applications don't need*. This may sound surprising, so please bear with me, and consider an application that displays the database content on screen:

This application needs to update its UI, on the main thread, from the freshest database values. As the application is setting up its views from those values, background threads can write in the database, and make those values obsolete even before screen pixels have been refreshed.

Is it a problem if the app draws stale database content? RxGRDB's answer is *no*, as long as the application is eventually notified with refreshed values. And this is the job of [values observables](#values-observables).

**There are very few use cases for changes observables.** For example:

- One needs to synchronize the content of the database file with some external resources, like other files, or system sensors like CLRegion monitoring.

- On iOS, one needs to process a database transaction before the operating system had any opportunity to put the application in the suspended state.

- One want to build a [database snapshots](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/master/README.md#database-snapshots) with a guaranteed snapshot content.

Outside of those use cases, it is much likely *wrong* to use a changes observables. Please [open an issue] and come discuss if you have any question.


## Values Observables

**Values Observables are all about getting fresh database values**.

They all emit in the RxSwift scheduler of your choice, or, by default, on the main queue:

```swift
// On any thread
Player.all().rx
    .fetchAll(in: dbQueue)
    .subscribe(onNext: { players: [Player] in
        // On the main queue
        print("Players have changed.")
    })
```

When a values observable is subscribed from the main queue, and doesn't specify any specific scheduler, you are guaranteed that the initial values are synchronously fetched:

```swift
// On the main queue
Player.all().rx
    .fetchAll(in: dbQueue)
    .subscribe(onNext: { players: [Player] in
        print("Players have changed.")
    })
// <- Here "Players have changed" is guaranteed to be printed.
```

This guarantee is lifted whenever you provide a specific scheduler, or when the observable is not subscribed from the main queue:

```swift
Player.all().rx
    .fetchAll(in: dbQueue, scheduler: MainScheduler.instance)
    .subscribe(onNext: { players: [Player] in
        print("Players have changed.")
    })
// <- Here "Players have changed" may not be printed yet.
```

Unlike initial values, all changes notifications are always emitted asynchronously:

```swift
try dbQueue.inDatabase { db in
    try Player(name: "Arthur").insert(db)
}
// <- Here "Players have changed" may not be printed yet.
```

Depending on whether you use a [database queue], or a [database pool], the values emitted by such an observable are exactly the same. But the concurrent behavior changes.

- [Values Observables in a Database Queue](#values-observables-in-a-database-queue)
- [Values Observables in a Database Pool](#values-observables-in-a-database-pool)


### Values Observables in a Database Queue

In a [database queue], values observables fetch fresh values immediately after an [impactful](#what-is-database-observation) transaction has completed.

**They block all threads that are accessing the database, or attempting to access in the database, until fresh values are fetched:**

```swift
Player.all().rx
    .fetchAll(in: dbQueue)
    .subscribe(onNext: { players: [Player] in
        // On the main queue
        print("Players have changed.")
    })
    
try dbQueue.inTransaction { db in
    try Player(name: "Arthur").insert(db)
    return .commit // waits until fresh players have been fetched
}
```

Fortunately, fetching values is usually [quite fast](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/wiki/Performance).

Yet some complex queries take a long time, and you may experience undesired blocking. In this case, consider replacing the database queue with a database pool, because that's what database pools are for: *efficient multi-threading*.


### Values Observables in a Database Pool

In a [database pool], values observables *eventually* fetch fresh values after an [impactful](#what-is-database-observation) transaction has completed.

**They block all threads that are writing in the database, or attempting to write in the database, until [snapshot isolation](https://sqlite.org/isolation.html) has been established:**

```swift
Player.all().rx
    .fetchAll(in: dbPool)
    .subscribe(onNext: { players: [Player] in
        // On the main queue
        print("Players have changed.")
    })
    
try dbPool.writeInTransaction { db in
    try Player(name: "Arthur").insert(db)
    return .commit // waits for snapshot isolation establishment
}
```

Acquiring snapshot isolation is very fast. The only limiting resource is the maximum number of concurrent reads (see [database pool configuration]).

After snapshot isolation has been established, the values observable fetches fresh values. Meanwhile, other threads can freely read and write in the database :tada:!


## Common Use Cases of Values Observables

### Consuming fetched values on the main thread

```swift
// On any thread
Player.all().rx
    .fetchAll(in: dbQueue)
    .subscribe(onNext: { players: [Player] in
        // On the main queue
        print("Players have changed.")
    })

// On any thread
dbQueue
    .fetchTokens(in: [Player.all()])
    .mapFetch { (db: Database) -> ([Player], Int) in
        // In a database protected dispatch queue
        let players = try Player.order(scoreColumn.desc).limit(10).fetchAll(db)
        let count = try Player.fetchCount(db)
        return (players, count)
    }
    .subscribe(onNext: { (players, count) in
        // On the main queue
        print("Best ten players out of \(count): \(players)")
    })
```

### Consuming fetched values off the main thread

The first example is OK, even if the main thread is still involved as a relay. Subsequent examples don't use the main thread at all:

```swift
let scheduler = SerialDispatchQueueScheduler(qos: .default)

// On any thread
Player.all().rx
    .fetchAll(in: dbQueue)
    .observeOn(scheduler) // hops from main thread to global dispatch queue
    .subscribe(onNext: { db: Database in
        // Off the main thread, in the global dispatch queue
        print("Players have changed.")
    })

// On any thread
Player.all().rx
    .fetchAll(in: dbQueue, scheduler: scheduler)
    .subscribe(onNext: { db: Database in
        // Off the main thread, in the global dispatch queue
        print("Players have changed.")
    })

// On any thread
dbQueue
    .fetchTokens(in: [Player.all()], scheduler: scheduler)
    .mapFetch { (db: Database) -> ([Player], Int) in
        // In a database protected dispatch queue
        let players = try Player.order(scoreColumn.desc).limit(10).fetchAll(db)
        let count = try Player.fetchCount(db)
        return (players, count)
    }
    .subscribe(onNext: { (players, count) in
        // Off the main thread, in the global dispatch queue
        print("Best ten players out of \(count): \(players)")
    })
```
